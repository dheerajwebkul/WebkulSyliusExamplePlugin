## UPGRADE FOR `1.3.x`

### FROM `1.3.x` TO `1.3.13`

If you're using an "Accept" HTTP header to set the serialization groups, you need to define allowed groups
either by passing them as default in `serialization_groups` setting or marking them as allowed in 
`allowed_serialization_groups` setting, both settings are set in the route definition (under `_sylius` key).
